# TechShopPOS
###  Fast, convenient point-of-sale for repair shops
Language: *JavaScript*<br />
Framework: *(none)*<br />
Database: *Firebase*<br />

## Goal of the Project
As a cell phone and computer repair shop owner, I was tired of paying high monthly prices for point-of-sale systems that had hundreds of bells and whistles that didn't apply to me. I wanted a POS system that could check-in a device in 30 seconds instead of five minutes. I wanted to be able to upload an Excel spreadsheet that would automatically update all the repair prices instead of having to go one-by-one in the system. I wanted a to be able to hook up any touch screen device, whether it be an iPad, a phone, or even an old touch monitor as a customer screen so they could sign off on repairs. I wanted sales figures, ticket counts, and device types to be accessible with one click of a button.

## Usage
The app is currently being used in the Alpha stage in two locations in Arizona. You can see the demo of the app [here](https://brent-test-pos.web.app/).

## The Result
This was the first time I really dove into programming with JavaScript. I knew I wanted it to be a single-page app, but at this point I didn't really know anything about React or Vue. It ended up working and teaching me a lot about JS, but I'm currently in the process of re-making it with React so that I can shop it around to other repair shops. I'm hoping to have a Beta version by March of 2023.
